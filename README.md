[**A reproducible run is available at IEEE Code Ocean**](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1245864.v1)

[**Data is also available at IEEE DataPort**](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/qx2p-4627)

### Aims of this study
1. Exploring how to generate the experience needed to train agents.

2. Verifying that deep reinforcement learning can solve control planning for PV-battery systems.

3. Contributing reusable code to the problem of quantifying PV-BESS dispatch availability with DRL.
