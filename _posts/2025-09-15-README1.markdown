### For editors and reviewers from IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics before the code is published on IEEE Code Ocean:
[**Source code, data, and an example for review shared via github (current submission)**](https://github.com/Nero51908/pv-bess-ddpg-review)

[**Data is also available at IEEE DataPort**](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/qx2p-4627)


### Aims of this study
1. Exploring how to generate the experience needed to train agents.

2. Verifying that deep reinforcement learning can solve control planning for PV-battery systems.

3. Contributing reusable code to the problem of quantifying PV-BESS dispatch availability with DRL.
